# Exploratory Data Analysis with SweetViz

This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python, leveraging the powerful SweetViz library for generating comparative visualizations and insights.

## Overview

The objective of this project is to streamline the data analysis process by automating statistical comparisons and visual reporting. The included SweetViz report provides a detailed comparison between datasets, highlighting key differences and insights at a glance.

## Features

- **Automated EDA**: Quickly analyze and compare datasets.
- **Visual Reporting**: SweetViz generates an intuitive, interactive HTML report with visual summaries of the data.
- **Custom Workflow**: Jupyter Notebook with Python-based scripting for additional customization.

## File Structure

- **`Project 2.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for:
  - Loading datasets.
  - Generating SweetViz reports.
  - Additional analysis and data cleaning steps.
- **`SweetViz_Comparison.html`**: A SweetViz-generated report showcasing comparative statistics and visualizations for the datasets.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**:
  - `SweetViz` for visual EDA.
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `numpy` for numerical operations.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for an interactive coding environment.
- **HTML** for rendering the SweetViz report.

## Data Sources

The datasets used for this analysis were generated or sourced from the following:
- **Example Dataset 1**: Hypothetical data on customer demographics.
- **Example Dataset 2**: Simulated sales data for comparative analysis.
